	<h2>About Us</h2>
	<hr>
	<p>Government provides scholarships to needy students both
		undergraduate and postgraduates. This portal is an attempt to transfer
		money either via online or offline to enhance the welfare of people by
		helping in business,studies,etc. It follows a particular pattern for
		the improvement by transferring grants and benefits through
		Scholarships. The key purpose of this website is to ensure adequate
		implementation and expenditure of scholarships within the state. For
